# Github and remote repositories
To store your code online and collaborate with other people, you need a remote repository service. One such service is Github. Other common ones are Bitbucket or Gitlab. If you are working at a larger enterprise, you might be using something like Azure DevOps.

## Git vs Github
Git = Distributed version-control system  
Github = Repository hosting service

## Remote repository
Your local repository is the same as the remote repository structure-wise:  
Working directory | Staging area | Git repository

To interact with the remote repository you use the following commands: `git fetch`/`git pull` to fetch or `git push` to push.

A remote repository is a single point of interaction for all of the collaborators of a project
